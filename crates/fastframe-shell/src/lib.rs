//! Keep an egui app running without a window, recreate the window on demand,
//! and bring back windows restored off-screen.
//!
//! A messaging client or a music player keeps working with its window closed:
//! the connection, the playback, the tray item and the notifications live on.
//! eframe ties the event loop to the window, so ZapFast and Spotifast run
//! `eframe::run_native` in a loop. Closing the window with "keep running" on
//! destroys it; the app's state survives in a slot, and a headless loop keeps
//! calling the app until the tray, a notification, or another launch asks for
//! the window again, when a new one is made. [`Shell`] is that loop.

//!     )
//! })?;
//! # Ok::<(), eframe::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! The pieces:
//!
//! - [`Shell`] runs the loop around the app's own `run_native` call, starts
//!   hidden when asked, and idles between headless ticks through a function
//!   the app supplies (the tray crate's `idle`, which serves AppKit on macOS).
//! - [`Waker`] lets threads repaint whichever window exists, and does nothing
//!   while none does.
//! - [`window::recover_offscreen`] moves a window that opened on no connected
//!   monitor onto the primary one.
//!
//! Single-instance handling is not here: the apps use three different designs
//! (see the README).
